# About Me

I am a fourth year Computing Security major at RIT and currently working as a cybersecurity intern at Little Caesar's Enterprises. I am most experienced with application/software security as well as red teaming and penetration testing. I am always expanding my knowledge though and looking to learn more.&#x20;
