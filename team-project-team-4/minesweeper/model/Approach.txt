Two-D array approach:
    Create a Two-D array of cells with the location class.
        This would require adding a value paramater to the location class
        Would have to generate mines using a hashset and two for loops. 



Graph approach: (Personally I think this approach may be easier in the long run)
    Create an adjacency graph where each bomb would connect to each square around it that isn't another bomb. 
    Using this approach you could more easily find how many bombs are around a certian square by counting the amount of connections
    The setup for picking where the bombs are is also the same as the Two-D approach with the advantage that you could also create all
    important squares at the same time. In other words, this approach would also get rid of empty squares which are not within 
    "King Movement" of a bomb.
